#summary Syntax of Modules

= The Structure of Source Code for a Module =

We describe here the structure of declarations constituting the source code for a module that is contained in a file called <modname>.mod. As already explained, this source code file goes hand-in-hand with the signature file for the module and requires the latter to be used in its interpretation.

The Teyjus parser for the source code file consists of a part automatically generated by the _OCaml_ parser generator from a context-free grammar and a post processor that manipulates the (pre) abstract syntax structures generated by the automatically constructed parser. The post processing phase is needed to handle information such as arities of type constructors and operator fixities and precedence that is also gleaned through the parse. The grammar below represents the effect of the combined processing and should not be confused with the one that forms the input to the parser generator.

== A BNF Specification of Module Syntax ==

The rules below describe the syntax of the declarations that may appear in a module file. These grammar rules build on the ones already presented while explaining the syntax of signatures in [SigSyntax A BNF Specification of Signature Syntax]. Thus, to understand this grammar, it may be necessary to consult also the grammar for signatures.
