#summary About the Name of the Project and the System

_Teyjus_ is a word in Sanskrit that, amongst other things, means sharpness, edge, brilliance, splendour, vitality, strength, and majesty. Many of these are properties that the system aspires to in the long haul. As with all words from a different language, and especially one with a rich variety of sounds not present in English, there is a question of what the 'right' transliteration for the name is. One found commonly in Sanskrit to English dictionaries is _t√©g-as_. However, we found it difficult to steer others to the right pronounciation using this way of writing the name and, of course, we would like everyone to pronounce the name correctly. The way we have chosen to write the name might make the task easier. Here is some help: try saying 'Tey' like you would 'Day' except for replacing the first letter with 'T', and 'jus' like you would 'just' but for leaving out the last letter. This should get you close; unfortunately, there is no sound in English exactly like the one the first 'T' is intended to represent.
