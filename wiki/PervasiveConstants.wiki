#summary Pervasive constants

= Pervasive Constants in Teyjus =

The following symbols are recognized as constants with the associated attributes. Those of these symbols that are not categorized as keywords (see section Characterization of Tokens in Teyjus) can be redefined by the user.

~
    overloaded prefix operator of type (int -> int) or (real -> real). Nonassociative and with higher precedence than everything else except application.

+

    overloaded infix left associative operator with precedence level 150 and type either (int -> int -> int) or (real -> real -> real).

-

    overloaded infix left associative operator with precedence level 150 and type either (int -> int -> int) or (real -> real -> real).

`*`
   overloaded infix left associative operator with precedence level 160 and type either (int -> int -> int) or (real -> real -> real).
abs

   overloaded prefix operator of type (int -> int) or (real -> real). 
div

    infix left associative operator with precedence level 160 and type int -> int -> int.
/

    infix left associative operator with precedence level 160 and type real -> real -> real.
mod

    infix left associative operator with precedence level 160 and type int -> int -> int.
int_to_real

    of type int -> real.
sqrt

    of type real -> real.
sin

    of type real -> real. Argument is in radians.
cos

    of type real -> real. Argument is in radians.
arctan

    of type real -> real. Result (when evaluation is forced) is in radians.
ln

    of type real -> real.
floor

    of type real -> int.
ceil

    of type real -> int.
truncate

    of type real -> int.
^

    of type string -> string -> string, representing string concatenation.
size

    of type string -> int, representing the length function on strings.
chr

    of type int -> string.
string_to_int

    of type string -> int representing the usual ord function on characters (encoded as single character strings).
substring

    of type string -> int -> int -> string. When evaluated, (substring s i j) returns the string of length j that starts at position i (zero indexed) in s. The result is undefined if i < 0, j < 0 or the length of s is less than i + j.
int_to_string

    of type int -> string. When evaluated, the result returned is a string rendition of the integer value of the first argument.
real_to_string

    of type real -> string. When evaluated, the result returned is a string rendition of the real value of the first argument.
std_in

    of type in_stream, representing the standard input stream
std_out

    of type out_stream, representing the standard output stream
std_err

    of type in_stream, representing the standard error stream
nil

    of type (list A), representing the (polymorphic) nil list
::

    representing the usual list constructor; infix right associative with precedence level 140 and type (A -> (list A) -> (list A)).
