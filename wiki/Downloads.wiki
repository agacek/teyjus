== How to Build Teyjus ==

Teyjus is designed to work on many architectures and operating systems.

  * Linux and Mac OS X: LinuxBuild
  * Windows via Cygwin toolchain: CygwinBuild
  * Windows via Microsoft toolchain: MicrosoftBuild

Windows users may use either the Cygwin or Microsoft toolchain, though users with no preference should follow the Cygwin instructions as they are slightly simpler and correspond closer to the Linux instructions.

== Other Platforms ==

If your operating system is not listed above, you should follow the instructions in LinuxBuild. If you are able to build Teyjus successfully, please report your operating system and architecture so we can expand the list of supported platforms. Alternatively, if you have any difficulty building Teyjus, please report this as a bug on the [http://code.google.com/p/teyjus/issues/entry issue tracker].
