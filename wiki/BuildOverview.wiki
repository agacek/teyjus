#summary How to build Teyjus

Teyjus is designed to work on many architectures and operating systems. Users of Linux and Mac OS X should follow the instructions in LinuxBuild. Windows users can build Teyjus using either the Cygwin toolchain (CygwinBuild) or the Microsoft toolchain (MicrosoftBuild). Users with no preference should follow the Cygwin instructions as they are slightly simpler and correspond closer to the Linux instructions.

If you operating system is not listed above, you should follow the instructions in LinuxBuild. If you are able to build Teyjus successfully, please report your operating system and architecture so we can expand the list of supported platforms. Alternatively, if you have any difficulty building Teyjus, please report this as a bug on our [http://code.google.com/p/teyjus/issues/entry issue tracker].
