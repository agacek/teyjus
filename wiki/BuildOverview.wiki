#summary How to build Teyjus

Teyjus is designed to work on many architectures and operating systems.

  * Linux and Mac OS X: LinuxBuild
  * Windows via Cygwin toolchain: CygwinBuild
  * Windows via Microsoft toolchain: MicrosoftBuild

Windows users may use either the Cygwin or Microsoft toolchain, though users with no preference should follow the Cygwin instructions as they are slightly simpler and correspond closer to the Linux instructions.
