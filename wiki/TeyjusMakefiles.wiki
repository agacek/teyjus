#summary How to write a Makefile for your Teyjus code

When working on a Teyjus project, a Makefile can help manage your build dependencies. The following Makefile should be used as a template.

{{{
TJROOT = /usr/local/bin

.PHONY: all
all: main.lp

%.lpo : %.mod %.sig
	$(TJROOT)/tjcc $*

%.lp : %.lpo
	$(TJROOT)/tjlink $*

-include depend
depend: *.mod *.sig
	$(TJROOT)/tjdepend *.mod > depend-stage
	mv depend-stage depend

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f *.lpo *.lp depend
}}}

To customize this Makefile for your project, adjust the `TJROOT` path as necessary and change `main.lp` to be the top-level module of your system. Multiple such top-level files can be specified. All other aspects of compilation-order and dependencies are managed by the generic portions of the Makefile.
