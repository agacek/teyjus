= Builtin sorts and type constructors =

Teyjus embodies an understanding of the following primitive types
 	
{{{
   int          for integers in an implementation determined range. Teyjus supports
                integers in the range (-2**25,2**25).

   real         for reals in an implementation determined range. Teyjus currently 
                supports a representation based on a 15 bit mantissa and 7 bit 
                exponent representation.

   string       for the type of strings

   in_stream    for input streams

   out_stream   for output streams

   o            for the type of propositions
}}}

Teyjus also supports the following type constructors
 	
{{{
   list         the unary type constructor for lists
