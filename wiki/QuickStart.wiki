= A Tutorial Introduction to Programming Using the Teyjus System =

_Apologies for now, but coming soon._

This wiki will assume a knowledge of Prolog and then will

   * step the reader through the process of translating simple Prolog programs to Teyjus syntax

   * exhibit some of the higher-order features

   * motivate the use of higher-order abstract syntax in manipulating objects whose structure involves binding

   * explain the intended paradigm for the modularity constructs, especially accumulation, the role of signatures and the purpose of _exportdef_ and _useonly_ annotations.
